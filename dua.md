## The importance of asking

“And your Lord has said: Pray unto Me and I will hear your prayer.” (40:60)

"Whoever draws close to Me by the length of a hand, I will draw close to him by the length of an arm.
Whoever draws close to Me the by length of an arm, I will draw close to him by the length of a fathom.
Whoever comes to Me walking, I will come to him running." (Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim 2687)

"Ask and it will be given to you;
seek and you will find;
knock and the door will be opened to you.
for everyone who asks receives;
the one who seeks finds;
and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened." (Matthew 7:7-8)

## In the footsteps of Abu Darda (R.A) 

Abu Darda (R.A) said: “I make dua for seventy of my brothers while mentioning their names”

Abu Darda would spend each night, praying for his family, friends and for his community.

Let us honour this beautiful practice.
