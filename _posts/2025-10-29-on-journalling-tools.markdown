Part 2 : Practical tools to start journalling 

Here are some tools and prompts I've found helpful over the years, feel free to try them out and adapt them: 

### The Pennebaker Protocol
This involves writing freely for a set time about what’s unsettling you. Write about difficult conversations, hurt feelings, awkward moments, or emotional conflicts — and explore the fears and concerns tied to them. It's helpful to mindmap the circumstance, write down emotions that arise and then write without interruption. 

Prompts like *“I’m recognising that…,” “realising…,” “understanding…,” “because of…,”* and *“noticing that…”* focus on meaning-making.  
Making sense of our inner world reduces the intensity, frequency, and duration of repetitive or distressing thoughts and emotions.

### Prompts for Reflection

Try dropping these into the waters of the mind and see what ripples out:

### Reflections

- What distractions or avoidance patterns showed up today?  
- What am I grateful for?  
- Which talents and skills can I use to benefit others?  
- How can I thank my past self and send goodness ahead to my future self?

### Ask yourself:

- Did I really recognise/understand/realise what I just said or did?  
- How could I have done it differently?  
- What impact did this have on me and others?
- Can I forgive myself for not understanding ? Can I forgive the other person for not understanding/knowing ? 


## Core Virtues

Did I embody these well today ? What can I do to improve in each area ? 

- Wisdom  
- Love  
- Courage  
- Justice

## Hindrances

Acknowledging these errors, understanding why they arose, and making amends is our path to freedom:

- Sense desire  
- Torpor & sloth  
- Ill-will  
- Restlessness  
- Doubt  



### Daily Nourishment 

Did I get enough of these today ? 

- Connecting  
- Learning  
- Being active  
- Spending time in nature  
- Giving back  
- Eating well  
- Resting  
- Sleeping

## Decision-Making Prompts
- Why is this important to me?  
- What if this option or belief is incorrect? What impact would that have?  
- What would God want of me in this situation ? 

Assess decisions by weighing:
- Benefits  
- Risks  
- Alternatives  
- Unknowns  
- Safety nets

### Topics
Choose a topic or theme that’s important to you and mind-map out associations.  
Drill down further using the **5W1H** questions: *Who, What, Why, Where, When, How.*

---

### Thought Errors and Distortions to Watch Out For
- All-or-nothing thinking  
- Overgeneralisation  
- Mental filter  
- Disqualifying positives  
- Jumping to conclusions  
- Personalisation  
- Emotional reasoning  
- Should/must/have to statements  
- Labelling and mislabelling  
- Magnifying or minimising
