Mind full or mind empty ? 

### Introduction

`"It is God who has created the heavens and the earth and everything in between in six aeons, then established Himself on the Throne. 
You have no protector or intercessor besides Him. 
Will you not then be mindful? (32:4)"`
 
The Qur’an instructs us to be mindful. 

But what does it mean to be mindful ? I find these questions fascinating : 

- What are we being mindful of ? 
- What is our end goal ?  
- What is its importance in Islam (beyond applying it in a purely secular manner) ? 
- How do we experience and embody the attribute of Ar-Raqeeb [الرقيب] (The Watchful, all observing Witness) ?

These are key questions to reflect on in order to live life fully. The ultimate goal of mindfulness can be seen as choosing an object of focus and noticing how our attention moves from it. Thus, by recognising how the mind wanders and gently bringing it back, we start to arrive at a higher plane of consciousness more frequently. 

Then, through this training we can transcend our shifting experiences and return to the ultimate Reality more often throughout the day. We can truly tune in to the presence of Allah, the beauty of nature, other people and indeed, even our inner experiences.

### Unifying the mind 

Mindfulness can be understood as awareness in the moment  (paying attention to how our attention moves with an attitude of curiosity and wonder and then bringing it back).

`"... and hold firmly together to the rope of God and do not be divided. (3:103)"`

Even though the preceding verse is a warning about splitting into factions, it can be applied to our own internal system, which can be split up into various disintegrated parts if it is without a strong core. 

Rather than splitting and dividing our attention between multiple objects and whims we can return to our object of focus. A person can be aware of what is in the forefront of consciousness (stimuli and reactions both internal and external) in terms of thought, emotion, sensations, intentions as well as behaviours.

This can be contrasted with mindlessness where there is a lack of awareness or knowledge of these movements of attention : 

`"They are the ones whose hearts, ears, and eyes are sealed by God, and it is they who are truly heedless.(16:108)"`

A person can thus be swept away by the tides of stimuli and their behaviour can represent an automaton. Being mindful means we rise above this robotic, stimulus → reaction existence.

`“Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now.” ('Man's search for Meaning, V. Frankl)` 

There are times when we get that intuition or signal between that space of stimulus and  response.

If we understand it and  choose a better option, it can be game changing.

Mindfulness is not a separate practice to only do at a specified time but it is about nurturing this quality in each and every moment throughout the day. It can be cultivated at any age and children can be key reminders to us about the importance of fully immersing ourselves in life, moment to moment.

Improving our daily life through  increasing instances of mindfulness means we are able to understand the impact of various stimuli and stories that our minds create. We can then choose from a bigger range of options in terms of how to respond to situations when we see these sequences. We can choose our attitude and behaviour by keeping our interpretations in check (by developing awareness of thought processes [seen as scripts running in the mind] and cultivating our psyche like a garden (weeding out what is harmful and nurturing what is healthy and helpful).

There is a time that we can then go beyond techniques and arrive in true presence. Through this the end goal is to develop composure in the face of any circumstance and to live each of our precious moments dedicated to the worship of our Creator (by tuning in to what is being asked of us in any given period of time). In this way, worship can take the form of keeping God in mind in whatever we do.

### Thoughts

>“Watch your thoughts, they become your words; watch your words, they become your actions; watch your actions, they become your habits; watch your habits, they become your character; watch your character, it becomes your destiny.” 
― Lao Tzu

`"...then each soul will know what it has sent forth [prioritised] or left behind [delayed]. (82:5)"`

عَلِمَتْ نَفْسٌۭ مَّا قَدَّمَتْ وَأَخَّرَتْ ٥ 

We have an immense number of thoughts throughout the day. Just like our heart constantly pumps blood, our brain and mind work together to ‘pump’ thoughts. 

Our relationship with thoughts in this age of speed is arguably the most challenging area to be mindful of as we can quite easily get swept away by their sheer quantity and force. With modern high stimulus environments and pressures, it is very easy to have a mind overcrowded with thoughts and cares. 

By approaching our relationship to thoughts we can start to question whether we are our thoughts or if they are something that we can take a step back from. What would happen if you saw them as cloud patterns in a vast sky ? Trains that we can choose to take ?  Traffic on the road ?  The waves in the sea ? 

By understanding these analogies (especially of wave forms and the sea) we can start to be mindful of how thoughts occur and how they pass. In prostration a person can often start to notice that thoughts can slow down or thought cycles get broken in order to gain freedom from this attachment to thoughts and thinking. Let us consider the analogy of a sea and its waves. In a particular area, within a given period of observation, we can notice the frequency (number of waves), intensity (height of a wave) and duration (time a particular pattern occurs). We can thus understand that the sea may be calm (few waves, smaller in height that have a a easier time to manage or a raging sea with mountainous waves, crashing into each other and coming thick and fast). Being mindful of thoughts thus allows us to have a healthier relationship with them and give us the freedom to enjoy other aspects of our experiences. 

A maxim to keep in mind is that thought waves do pass and it is how we surf those waves that shape our experience. We can ask ourselves, how would we like to surf the current waves ?

### This too shall pass

We can increase our mindfulness of thoughts by noticing and letting them go, by simply acknowledging when our mind has wandered (it is optional to evaluate whether this thinking is helpful or fruitful). 

If we take another analogy of thoughts as soap bubbles, continuing to chase and pop each one would leave us exhausted. Instead we can notice their shape, let them float away or appreciate them with wonder and curiosity.

However, we can also notice if our thoughts are shaped a certain way. Investigating the source can do wonders for us. If we examine the bubble maker, we can look into our core beliefs and inner programs that are producing those thoughts. 

By delving further into meditation we can open the task manager of the mind and curate it in order to improve the chances of wholesome thoughts. Thoughts can be about the past, engaged with the present, or jump ahead to the future (often anticipating and calculating). How does this mindfulness of thoughts benefit us ? By noticing these shifts, in time we can gently bring the mind back to the present more often in order to devote all of our energy to the present task and remember the key reason we are doing it. This involves being aware of the various parts inside of us and marshalling them towards a common unified purpose. 

This also allows us to take a break from the deluge of thoughts.  We can often notice pressure or tension building in our bodies from thoughts being too frequent and coming too fast, leading to events piling up unprocessed. This can physically manifest as pressure in the head or neck area. By taking a step back from this waterfall of thoughts, we can gain some relief. Here, it is important to consider, what are some activities that help create some distance from thoughts and get us out of the intellectual/analytical sphere ?

### Emotions

Another key area to be mindful of is our emotions. What are emotions ? 


These questions are fascinating as feelings play a larger part in our decision making process than we might realise:

- How do they  manifest ? 
- What do our bodies feel like when they arise ?  When they pass ?
- What effects can they have on our decision making ?
- What’s the best way to go about understanding them better ? 

Emotions can be understood as a system created by God to provide us with signals and signs about our experiences.  They can conquer our wiser selves when left unchecked, unprocessed and unresolved. 

Being mindful of emotions means understanding how we are feeling in any given moment. The first step is to simply recognise and allow the emotion to exist without trying to push it away/suppress it (the original meaning of kufr is to cover or bury) or conversely be completely drowned by it if we indulge it. This can be followed up with genuine curiosity and questions to develop a better understanding.  We can then ultimately asking ourselves what we would like most in that moment (e.g. validation, compassion or understanding).  

Further expression can take place through journaling, music, talking and art. Unexpressed or unresolved emotions that have been pushed down can often surface in dreams or behaviours where our conscious minds can no longer hold them at bay. Being mindful of them means we can address them in time. 

Emotions can have enormous depth, from primary emotions of fear, happiness, sadness, anger, surprise and disgust to secondary and tertiary. Being mindful of their intensity as well as the range  (having the vocabulary to describe them)  allows us to access and understand them better. 

Reading and developing a sounder ‘Theory of Mind’ (appreciating how others perceive and understand the world) through literature is also an excellent way to understand not only ourselves but others better. By being mindful of emotions, we can come to similar conclusions as we do about thoughts, that they are temporary. They can be understood as signals that inform us rather than forces that dictate what we do.

### Senses

`"We will show them Our signs in the universe and within themselves... (41:53)"`

Senses, the doors of perception, are the primary way we notice and interact with the world around us. By being more mindful of our immediate environment and being a witness, we can fully immerse ourselves in and enjoy our experiences. 

This can be done by simple techniques e.g. noticing and naming 5 things we can see, 4 sounds, 3 points of contact with our body, 2 fragrances and 1 taste we can make out. 

This gives us some more space from being immersed in thought and opens our field of awareness. Thus we are able to truly appreciate the wonders around us in order to be more grateful. This then means we can savour the sunlight warming up our skin, birds singing in the morning, the richness of a sunset, the fragrance of a rose as well as the full appreciation of a meal. Being mindful in these sphere can increase our levels of gratitude and instil a sense of curiosity about the natural world. 

### Breath

`"..then He fashioned them and had a spirit of His own creation breathed into them. (32:9)"`

Breathing and noticing the breath is one of the simplest anchors to the present moment. 

However, how often do we notice our breathing patterns ? 

- Their lengths ? 
- Their depth ? 
- What information might this give us ? 
- That we're holding something in ? 

By noticing the breath that gives us life and nourishes us, we can tune in to our internal state much more easily (e.g. whether it is shallow or short, there may be a stressor affecting our system). 

Noticing our breathing doesn’t require any extra equipment and is the most accessible gateway to strengthen our ability to be mindful. It is the home base and anchor that never leaves us and gives us the opportunity to be thankful for each breath and return to a smile for the gift of being alive.

There are numerous techniques to increase mindfulness thorough breathing practice. One of the most effective techniques is the long exhale sigh out, which allows us to release stressors that can overwhelm us. Being mindful of our breathing can be taken as the cornerstone of mindfulness. We can then anchor to a sense of appreciation and return to a higher plane of consciousness.

### Spirit

`"Have you seen those who have taken their own desires as their god? 
And so God left them to stray knowingly, sealed their hearing and hearts, and placed a cover on their sight. 
Who then can guide them after God ? Will you all not then be mindful? (45:23)"` 

Noticing the state of the heart and soul is a key responsibility for those who would like to stay concious of God .

- What state is our soul in ? 
- Are we able to focus in prayer ? 
- What is the ultimate goal of mindfulness ? 
- Are we transcending the lower plane (Dunya – coming from the word ‘adna’ which means low’) and ascending to what is higher (towards God’s attributes and their embodied understanding) ? 

By mindfully attending to our experiences, using virtues such as patience, courage, wisdom and love, we can rise above vices such as laziness, ill will, doubt and indulgence. Satan will always come at us from all sides to whisper to us about taking the lower path, yet being mindful will allow us to keep the end in mind and choose a superior route. It allows us to move past our narrow view and subjectivity of experience to arrive at the greater Truth.

### Conclusion

`"So where are you people going ? (81:26)"`
 
فَأَيْنَ تَذْهَبُونَ ٢٦

By tuning in to what God wants of us and remembering our intention with Bismillah (from the beginning, middle to the end of any process) we can reorient ourselves towards the true purpose of any activity and purify our intention. 

Continually cleansing our thoughts, emotions, sensation and behaviours means that we are in a better position to understand signals that are messages from the divine. Our mirror has been sufficiently polished to better reflect the light This can be a lifelong journey of continual cleansing but it is indeed a worthy endeavour. The path of mindfully attending to each sphere of our experiences means we can be grateful for them, despite how arduous it may seem. When the alternative is sleepwalking through our lives, we risk living a life half lived. So the challenge for us all today is, how and where would you like to be more mindful ? Where is your consciousness leading you to ?
