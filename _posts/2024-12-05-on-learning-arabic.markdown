From stumbling to success...

### Introduction

Is learning Arabic really that important ?  Can’t I get by with English instead ? What’s wrong with using a translation ? 

These questions inevitably surface in the mind of every Arabic learner, let alone any language learner. Yet, even to have the chance of learning it and accessing these resouces is a privilege granted to only a few us. 

It’s not something we have to do, but that we *get* to do, a gift to open our hearts and souls to the Divine message. This is a sacred language that connects us to centuries of seekers.

### Motivation - defining our 'why'

Indeed, Arabic is intimidating when we look at the data (according to the Foreign Service Institute, USA Arabic is rated as a Category 4 language, alongside Chinese, Japanese and Korean, in terms of difficulty and class hours for English speakers.) Whereas, languages closer to English such as French and Spanish take far fewer hours. This is understandable, given the differences in pronunciation, writing paradigm and structure. However, by developing a clear reason for learning alongside a solid strategy, we significantly increase our chances of success. A steady resolve keeps us firm and helps us through the valleys of doubt and despair that we will come across along the way.  We can recognise this as a challenging task and ask ourselves, what would God want and expect from us ? What resources can we draw on to accomplish these goals ? Motivation can come and go but the discipline and consistency of a smart approach as well as help from higher up, is what ultimately helps us pass through.

`Truly, we have sent it down as an Arabic Quran so that you [people] may understand. (12:2)`

Shifting from *"Can I do this"* to "God will help me find a way through" helps us persevere and persist. 

The reasons for learning Arabic or even the type of Arabic can vary considerably. It is crucial to have a clear vision of where we want to go. This makes our learning journey simpler as it is anchored to a purpose.  Our efforts and energy are then concentrated enough to keep the path ahead illuminated. 

Questions such as : How do I learn best ? Do I want to learn Classical Arabic (Fusha) for Quran, Hadith and other literature ? Or would Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) suit my goals ?  Do I want the knowledge and skills of a specific dialect for travel ? 

Attempting too wide a goal can result in exhaustion and overload (e.g. the vocabulary for understanding the Qur’an can differ considerably with what is used in day to day Arabic). Therefore, clearly defining the goal is crucial in terms of how the syllabus is developed.  Each of these avenues is valid to seek, however it is important to be as purposeful as possible from the onset. This means being optimistic yet realistic with what we can learn in a given time period. 

By having a clear path, we can avoid such pitfalls and cultivate enough patientce to ultimately gain the joys of a working knowledge of Arabic. What seemed impossible then becomes achievable.

### The beauty of Arabic

Arabic is so precise in its usage that solely relying on a translation means that a crucial part of the experience is missing. The spirit, feel and beauty of the language get lost  (especially the eloquence, rhythm and rhyme in Literature). 

Arabic, especially in the Quran uses acoustic emphasis and elliptical passages to make a point (called Ijaz). The idiom and phraseology in its natural form can be exceedingly beautiful and the language seems to sing at its highest levels. 

Arabic is unique as a Semitic language that has remained in usage uninterruptedly since the Quran was revealed. Other languages used in sacred texts such as Hebrew had not been used in society till recently and had to be resurrected. By learning it, we are performing a sacred duty and integrating it as part of a rich heritage of Arabic literature and culture. 

Steadily we start learning Arabic not because we feel forced because we want to. We develop a love and yearning for the language and its quirks (how words can morph from their roots, how Classical Arabic roots are no longer than 5 letters and how we can acquire new words simply by decoding the root word).  The mindset of loving the process means that we switch to putting the joy and fascination back into our endeavour. Choosing ways that will suit us and that we’re likely to stick to makes a world of difference in terms of feeling that reward and personal happiness. Having our intention clear in this regard, e.g.  learning and understanding Arabic to enjoy the Quran or understand what is said in prayers, can help power us through. We can rely on English translations yet the flow, beauty and poetic nature of this text can easily get lost (despite incredible translations e.g M.A.S. Abdel Haleem). 

Connecting directly to the spirit of Arabic, allows us to understand not only with our minds but with our hearts and souls.  

`But he did not brave the steep path (90:11)`
  
`And what will explain to you what the steep path is? (90:12)`

### From struggle to fulfilment - the climb

If we liken learning a language such as Arabic to climbing a mountain, the path to competency and mastery can feel steep and a sense of overwhelm can easily conquer us. I got lost and felt frustrated numerous times, it humbled and still humbles me. Yet something inside me kept willing me to try again. 

There will be days when it doesn't seem to be going in and we question our resolve. To deal with doubt, it is important to set our sights on a goal that we can make daily sustained progress on, with concrete steps such as reading a certain number of pages (of material that we find interesting), or listening for a certain amount of time. By noticing periods of greater energy, we can set aside blocks of time to improve our language skills.

 Trying to ensure that there are no zero days in terms of activity or at least no two zero days in a row, ensures we make that steady progress. Having done this and solidifying our intention, we can then chart out a path and set out more confidently. There will be numerous challenges and pitfalls on the way (social media, weariness, frustration,restlessness/impatience, self doubt) so the attitude we chose in navigating these emotional challenges will be crucial. 
 
 Despite the advent of technology we can be mired in analysing different methods, leading to information overload and then give up before our efforts can bring us success. One step that  improves outcomes in language learning is to notice progress and celebrate each check point we reach (it may be as simple as grasping a concept and understanding it in practice, or getting the meaning of a whole sentence we wouldn't have known before). Enjoying that moment when we can order a meal in Arabic, or understand a sermon, or reply to a colleague can thus be immensely satisfying. Breaking the mission into easier to digest chunks, acknowledging achievements and progress, receiving positive feedback are fantastic ways to stick to these goals.

### Building blocks - the architecture of language

Now that we've recognised the challenges that await us, let's examine how we build the skills that we need. 

Learning any language involves the four core aspects of reading, writing, listening and speaking. They are crucial yet overemphasis on writing and speaking too early on can discourage learners as they don’t have the foundation to draw on. By choosing the approach of language acquisition (how we learned our mother tongue through immersion and stories) we can focus first on listening and reading texts we get the gist of. With this approach, our minds fill in the missing words, grasp how sentences are put together and tune in to the magic of the language. Resources such as Arabic Blooms, Arabic workshop (Seerah series), podcasts, Arabic stories are incredibly helpful for this. Language learning then becomes an adventure, a journey of discovery and play.

What do I hope to achieve with my efforts ? Can't I get by without all this grammar ? Trust me, I've been there too !
Grammar can sound like a scary concept yet it is essentially how we put words together so that they make sense. Choosing a course (such as Al-Quran institute, Arabic in 60 steps, Gateway to Arabic, Arabic Bayna yadayk), means that we embark on a structured programme that covers the basics. Supplementing this with reading and listening to materials we enjoy means that we’re able to put these concepts into practice and bring the language to life. By seeing Grammar as a puzzle for us to solve and put in the right order, we can frame the challenge correctly and approach it with an attitude of curiosity and wonder rather than avoidance and neglect.

### Vocabulary

For vocabulary, Arabic roots have a fascinating paradigm where we can notice patterns and incorporate new words by knowing how a word can morph into a new form:

k-t-b → kataba (he wrote), kitāb (book), maktab (office), maktūb (written).

The words can often echo deeper meanings. The word 'Ayat' can be translated as a 'verse' or as a 'sign/symbol/indicator/clue'. This leads us to a more complete meaning, which in turn allows us to contemplate the signs all around us. 
 
For increasing vocabulary, actively listening and reading allow for near effortless acquisition. Systems such as Anki (spaced repetition and recall) can be used to establish a firm imprint in our memory to move words from short to long term memory.

### Connection

For western readers, learning can also feel like a lonesome experience. Doing this with a tutor or a group can make a world of difference. Having others to connect with allows us to share insights and tips and keeps us accountable. Ultimately we are not meant to attempt it all alone. We can call out to others and ultimately God to support us, when we realise our limits. This can reconnect us to a higher power to replenish us with hope, courage and faith.

### Personal progress

Currently I participate in weekly Quran classes (analysing grammar), attending a fortnightly Quran circle (there are usually local groups nearby), listening to Quran and Fusha podcasts during downtime, reading Arabic books (stories of the prophets) and working to improve pronunciation through Tajweed classes. 

I intend to keep incorporating  Arabic in my life through personally fulfilling and rewarding ways. I have  learnt a great deal about myself during this process. The dead-ends, pitfalls and breakthroughs have all been precious to me. Finishing a story in Arabic and enjoying the process was a major turning point for me, it showed me that the mountain is climbable. 

I trust that sharing these experiences will smooth out the path for others. 

Even a simple act such as working on Book 1 of gateway to Arabic to improve one’s handwriting can start off a process that is so rewarding.

### Conclusion - the fruits of effort

The volume and amount of reps and effort we put in does ultimately make a difference, and the sacrifice and effort does ultimately pay off. When we approach this project wisely (with a strategy and targeted goals), lovingly (with self-compassion and understanding), courageously (pushing through and persevering), the amount of joy and amazement is out of this world, it can easily overcome any pain we might have or are having during the process. 

May this journey be successful and may you all receive the fruits of this wonderful language. The fruits are truly beyond what words can capture. 

> “Truly, with hardship comes more ease.” (94:6)
