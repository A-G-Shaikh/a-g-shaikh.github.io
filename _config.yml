# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

    I love to learn, discover and explore different branches of knowledge.  
    The root of the word Knowledge (~Gno) means to know, recognise and see the truth. Another root meaning is to be able to play with ideas, concepts and frameworks and see things from new angles. 
    Taking complex ideas, gathering their core concepts and simply explaining them is incredibly fulfilling for me.
    I hope that you can feel all my passion when reading my posts and that you may benefit from them.
