# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  My biggest passion is learning and sharing knoweldge.
  Knowledge (~Gno): To know, recognise and see the truth. To be able to play with ideas, concepts and frameworks and see things from new angles. 
    Taking complex topics and simply explaining them is incredibly fulfilling.
  When I’m finally done, it gives me satisfaction knowing that I've helped people to understand important topics !
    I hope that you can feel all my passion when reading my posts and that you may benefit from them !
