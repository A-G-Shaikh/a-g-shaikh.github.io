## In the pursuit of knowledge

Seeking knowledge is a sacred duty. 
I love to learn, discover and explore different branches of knowledge.  
The original root of the word 'Knowledge' (~Gno) means to know, recognise and see the Truth. 
Another root meaning is to be able to play with ideas, concepts and frameworks and see things from new angles.
Taking complex ideas, gathering their core concepts and simply explaining them in order to share what I've learnt is incredibly fulfilling for me.
I hope that you can feel all my passion when reading my posts and that you may benefit from them."

## My motivation for this website

A question that challenged me was asking myself, how much am I consuming ? 

How much am I creating ? 

What's the best way to rebalance this equation ?

How shall I consolidate and preserve what I've had the opportunity to learn ? 


`Abdullah bin Amr bin al-Aas (May God Most High be pleased with them both) said that the Messenger of God (PBUH) said, ‘Capture knowledge.’` 
`I said, how is it captured?` 
`He (PBUH) said, ‘By writing it.’ (al-Mustadrak, Hakim 362).`

Synthesising and summarising our built up stores of knowledge in order to safeguard and share it with others is a key responsibility. 
 
I realised that sharing and contributing, each in our own unique way so that others may benefit is a core responsibility for each and every person, in order to honour the provision each of us has been given. 

### Dua

May we all be granted the gifts of knowledge and be able to benefit from it. 

`“O God, benefit me with what you have taught me, teach me what will benefit me, and increase my knowledge."`
