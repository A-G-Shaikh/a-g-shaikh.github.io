## About


`Abdullah bin Amr bin al-Aas (May Allah Most High be pleased with them both) said that the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, ‘Capture knowledge.’` 

`I said, how is it captured?` 

`He (PBUH) said, ‘By writing it.’ (al-Mustadrak, Hakim 362).`

Synthesising and summarising our built up our stores of knowledge in order to share it with others is really important in this age. 

A question that challenged me was asking myself, how much am I consuming ? 

How much am I creating ? 

What's the best way to rebalance this equation ? 

I realised that sharing and contributing, each in our own unique way so that others may benefit is a core responsibility for each and every person, in order to honour the provision each of us has been given. 

`“O Allah, benefit me with what you have taught me, teach me what will benefit me, and increase my knowledge."`
